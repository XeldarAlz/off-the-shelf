Look at the currently staged changes using git diff --cached.

Generate a conventional commit message following the format:
  type(scope): description

Where type is one of: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, perf, ci, build

Keep the first line under 72 characters. Add a body if the change is non-trivial.

Then create the commit. Do not push.
