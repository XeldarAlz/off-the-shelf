Explain the provided code in plain language. Target audience: a developer who is new to this codebase.

Structure your explanation as:

1. **Purpose** — One sentence: what does this code do and why does it exist?

2. **How it works** — Walk through the logic step by step. Use simple language. Avoid jargon unless you define it.

3. **Key concepts** — List any design patterns, algorithms, or domain concepts a reader should know. Briefly explain each.

4. **Inputs and outputs** — What goes in, what comes out. Include types if relevant.

5. **Side effects** — Does it modify state, write to disk, make network calls, etc.?

6. **Complexity** — Estimate time and space complexity (Big O) for the core logic. Keep it practical — mention what drives the complexity (e.g., "O(n) where n is the number of users").

Keep it concise. Use bullet points over paragraphs. Skip obvious things (e.g., don't explain what a for-loop is).
